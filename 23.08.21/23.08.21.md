# APS 7. tree

## tree
### tree
- hierarchical structure
- represent and organize data in way that is easy to navigate and search
- collection of nodes

### terminology
node, vertex
- element of tree

edge
- a line which connects one with another

root
- topmost node

leaf node, external node
- the nodes which do not have any child nodes

child nodes
- the nodes below root

sibling node
- children of the same parent node

ancestor of a node
- any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node

subtree
- any node of the tree along with its descendant

degree
- the count of child nodes connected to the node
- degree of tree -> the biggest degree in the whole tree

level
- the count of edges on the path from the root node to the node
- level of tree -> the biggest level in the whole tree

## binary tree
### binary tree
- tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children
- the left and right child node

### properties of binary tree
- the maximum number of nodes at level i -> 2 ** i
- the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of level h -> 2 ** h - 1
- the minimum possible level in a binary tree with N nodes -> log2(N + 1)

### types of binary tree
full binary tree
- if every node has 0 or 2 children
- all nodes except leaf nodes have two children

complete binary tree
- if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

skewed binary tree
- the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes
- left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree

### traversal
- unlike linear data structures which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways

tree traversal techniques
- inorder traversal
  - traverse the left subtree
  - visit the root
  - traverse the right subtree
- preorder traversal
  - visit the root
  - traverse the left subtree
  - traverse the right subtree
- postorder traversal
  - traverse the left subtree
  - traverse the right subtree
  - visit the root
