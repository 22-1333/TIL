# control of flow
### conditional statement
keyword
```python
if, elif, else
```

### if statement
if expression is true, code block is executed
```python
if expression:
    '''
    code block
    '''
elif expression:
    '''
    code block
    '''
else:
    '''
    code block
    '''
```
_elif not simultaneously but sequentially_

nested conditional
```python
if expression:
    '''
    code block
    '''
    if expression:
        '''
        code block
        ''' 
elif expression:
    '''
    code block
    '''
    if expression:
        '''
        code block
        '''
else:
    if expression:
        '''
        code block
        '''
    '''
    code block
    '''
```

# loop statement
type
```python
for, while
```

### for statement
iterate sequence object in order that they appear in the sequence
```python
for variable in sequence_object:
    '''
    code block
    '''
```
_string also sequence object_

### while statement
iterate as long as the conditional remains true
```python
while conditional:
    '''
    code block
    '''
```

### loop control statement
- break statement
  - terminate a loop
- continue statement
  - returns the control to the beginning of the while loop

# list comprehension
### list comprehension
concise way to create list
```python
# 1
[expression for variable in iterable]

# 2
list(expression for variable in iterable)
```

list comprehension with if statement
```python
# 1
[expression for variable in iterable if conditional]
[expression if conditional else expression for variable in iterable]

# 2
list(expression for variable in iterable if conditional)
list(expression if conditional else expression for variable in iterable)
```
_do not overusing_

### three diffent ways to create list
for loop
```python
new_numbers = []
for number in numbers:
    new_numbers.append(int(number))
print(new_numbers) # [1, 2, 3]
```
map
```python
new_numbers_2 = list(map(int, numbers))
print(new_numbers_2) # [1, 2, 3]
```
list comprehension
```python
new_numbers_3 = [int(number) for number in numbers]
print(new_numbers_3) # [1, 2, 3]
```

_"Keep it simple, stupid"_

_"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the roof of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%"_

### pass
place-holder for a function
```python
def function_name():
    pass
```
do nothing in the conditional
```python
if conditional:
    pass
else:
```
keep looping by pass
```python
while True:
    if conditional:
        break
    elif conditional:
        pass
    else:
```

### enumerate
the position index and corresponding value
```python
enumerate(iterable, start = 0) # (position index, corresponding value)
```
