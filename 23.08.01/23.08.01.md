## algorithm
### definition
procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation

### methods of describing computer algorithms
- pseudocode
- flowchart

### criteria for good algorithm
- correctness
- amount of work done = time complexity
- amount of space used = space complexity
- simplicity
- optimality

### time complexity
Big-O Notation
- mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity
- upper-bound runtime or worst-case complexity

## array
one-dimentional array
- ex) gravity
  
two-dimentional array

## bubble sort
- repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order

time complexity
- O(n ^ 2)

```python
def bubble_sort(a, N):
    for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
        for j in range(0, j):
            if a[j] > a[j + 1]:
                a[j], a[j + 1] = a[j + 1], a[j]
```

## counting sort
- counting the number of objects having distinct key values

time complexity : O(n + k)
- n : list length, k : biggest integer in the list

```python
def counting_sort(A, B, k):
    # A = [] input list (0 to k)
    # B = [] arranged list
    # C = [] counting list

    C = [0] * (k + 1)

    for i in range(0, len(A)):
        C[A[i]] += 1

    for i in range(1, len(C)):
        C[i] += C[i-1]
    
    for i in range(len(B) - 1, -1, -1):
        C[A[i]] -= 1
        B[C[A[i]]] = A[i]
```

## exhaustive search
- systematically enumerates all possible solutions to a problem and checks each one to see if it is a valid solution
- brute-foce or generate-and-test

ex
- baby-gin game
- permutation

## greedy algorithm
- build a solutin part by part, choosing the next part in such a way, that is gives an immediate benefit

process
- selection procedure
- feasibility check
- solution check

ex
- baby-gin game
- least coin change
