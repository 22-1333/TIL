# django intro

## django & framework
### framework
- structure
- in computer programming
  - software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software
  - provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provieds particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions

the reason why it is required to use framework
- the framework enables developers to work efficiently on any project so that developers can achieve their goals smoothly
- work on any programming language easily
- highly flexible and scalable

### django framework
django
- python web framework
- server

### client & server
client -> server: requests
server -> client: responses

process of accessing a web page
1. write the desired address in the web browser(client)
2. client request for web page html file
3. server response with the web page html file

### django project & venv
venv
- virtual environment
- help to keep dependencies required by different projects seperate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them
- projects required different versions
- projects required each packages which are crashed with the others

create venv
```bash
python -m venv venv_name
```
- venv in gitignore

activate venv
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
- we did not move to venv but activate it
- source is the command only in git bash, different in other terminals
- or Python: Select Interpreter as venv and open new terminal

list installed packages
```bash
pip list
```

requirements
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
- only requirements in github
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

routine before django project
1. create venv
2. activate venv
3. install django
4. update requirements whenever installs new package

purpose of venv
- dependency management
- project collaboration

LTS
- long term support
- product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the sandard edition
- [django_versions]("https://www.djangoproject.com/download/")

## django design pattern
### django project & application
django project
- collection of configuration and apps for a particular website

django application
- web application that does something

create app
```bash
python manage.py startapp app_name
```

add app
```python
# /project/settings.py/

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  'new_app_name',
  'django.contrib.admin',
  'django.contrib.auth',
  'django.contrib.contenttypes',
  'django.contrib.sessions',
  'django.contrib.messages',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```
- add from the top

### django design pattern
design pattern
- typical solutions to common problems in software design
- each pattern is like a blueprin that one can customize to solve a particular design problem in the code

MVC design pattern
- model, view, controller
- data, user interface, business logic

MTV design pattern
- similar in style to MVC, but a better description of the way django does things
- model -> model -> models.py
- view -> template -> templates
- controller -> view -> views.py

project structure
- settings.py
  - project settings
- urls.py
  - connect url with the right views
- \_\_init.py\_\_
  - makes python treat directories as modules
- asgi.py
  - asnchronous server gataway interface
- wsgi.py
  - web server gateway interface
- manage.py
  - command line utility interact with django project

application structure
- admin.py
  - admin page settings
- models.py
  - define the structure of stored data
- views.py
  - takes http requests and return http response
- apps.py
  - application information
- tests.py
  - project test code

### request & response
django request & response
1. request
2. urls.py
3. views.py
4. models.py, templates
5. views.py
6. response

urls.py
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app_name import views

urlpatterns = [
  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  path('app_name/', views.req_func),
]
```
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/articles/ -> call index function in views module
- path must end with slash

views.py
```python
from Django.shortcuts import render


def req_func(request):
  return render(request, 'template_dir', context)
```
- always get request as first argument
- define request function
- context -> data used in template -> data type: dict

templates
- folder name must be templates
- base_url: app_name/templates/

coding
1. urls.py
  - add path
2. views.py
  - define request function
3. template
  - make template

# reference
### prettier
code formatter
- alt + shift + f

### pythonic
[ ]
- list in python
- array in any other languaged

_because it's pythonic_

why MTV in django?
