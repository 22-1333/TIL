# django intro

## django & framework
### framework
- structure
- in computer programming
  - software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software
  - provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provieds particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions

the reason why it is required to use framework
- the framework enables developers to work efficiently on any project so that developers can achieve their goals smoothly
- work on any programming language easily
- highly flexible and scalable

### django framework
django
- python web framework
- server

### client & server
client -> server: requests
server -> client: responses

process of accessing a web page
1. write the desired address in the web browser(client)
2. client request for web page html file
3. server response with the web page html file

### django project & venv
venv
- virtual environment
- help to keep dependencies required by different projects seperate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them
- projects required different versions
- projects required each packages which are crashed with the others

create venv
```bash
python -m venv venv_name
```
- venv in gitignore

activate venv
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
- we did not move to venv but activate it
- source is the command only in git bash, different in other terminals

list installed packages
```bash
pip list
```

requirements
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
- only requirements in github
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

routine before django project
1. create venv
2. activate venv
3. install django
4. update requirements whenever installs new package

purpose of venv
- dependency management
- project collaboration

LTS
- long term support
- product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the sandard edition
- [django_versions]("https://www.djangoproject.com/download/")

## django design pattern
### django project & application
django project
- collection of configuration and apps for a particular website

django application
- web application that does something

create app
```bash
python manage.py startapp app_name
```
