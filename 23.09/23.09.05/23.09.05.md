# CSS layout
## CSS box model
- a box that wraps around evert HTML element
- consists of content, padding, border, margin
- margin > border > padding > content

### different parts of box
- margin > border > padding > content
- content
  - content of the box, where text and images appear
- padding
  - clears an area around the content
  - transparent
- border
  - border that goes around the padding and content
- margin
  - clears an area outside the border
  - transparent

name of each direction
- top / bottom
- left / right
- height / width

### box-sizing
width & height
- size of content

box-sizing
- content-box
  - default
- border-box

```html
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 20px;
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
  .content-box {
    box-sizing: content-box;
  }
  .border-box {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
```

### box type
display
- block
- inline
- inline-block
- none

normal flow
- inline direction: row direction
- block direction: column direction

block type
- the box will break onto a new line
- the width and height properties are respected
- padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
- if width is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container
- block type tag
  - h1 ~ h6
  - p
  - div

inline type
- the box will not break onto a new line
- the width and height properties will not apply -> follow content size
- top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
- left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
- inline type tag
  - a
  - span
  - em / strong

inline-block
- middle point of inline type and block type
- difference with inline
  - allows to set a width and height on the element
  - the top and bottom margins and paddings are respected
- difference with block
  - does not add a line-break after the element
  - the element can sit next to other elements

none
- not in the display
- any space is not charged
- commonly used with Javascript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them

## CSS layout position
### CSS layout
- take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors
- display, position, float, flexbox and so on

### CSS position
- how an element is positioned in a document
- from normal flow to the other position
- static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky

normal flow
- the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport
- normally to the top left considering box type

static
- default
- positioned according to the normal flow
- the top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties have no effect

relative
- positioned according to the normal flow
- offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom and left not any other elements
- the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static 

absolute
- the element is removed from the normal document flow
- no space is created for the element in the page layout
- the element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any or to the initial containing block even body
- final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom and left 
- for elements fixed to the parent element

fixed
- the element is removed from the normal document flow
- no space is created for the element in the page layout
- the element is positioned relative to the viewport
- final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom and left
- usually gives 9999 z-index or -9999 z-index
- for fixed navigation bar or customer service

sticky
- positioned according to the normal flow
- the offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block, including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom and left
- always creates a new stacking context
- for top fixed menu bar

z-index
- set the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items
- overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one

## CSS layout flexbox
### CSS flexbox
- one-dimensional layout model
- space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities

terminology
- flex container, flex item
- main axis
  - main start, main end
- cross axis
  - cross start, cross end

### flexbox layout
1. flex container
  - display: flex;
2. flex-direction
  - default: row
  - main axis <- flex-direction
  - row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse
3. flex-wrap
  - default: nowrap
  - wrap, nowrap
4. justify-content
  - default: flex-start
  - through main axis
  - flex-start, flex-end, center
  - space-between, space-around, space-evenly
5. align-content
  - for total lines
  - through cross axis
  - when it comes to flex-wrap: wrap;
  - flex-start, flex-end, center
  - space-between, space-around, space-evenly
6. align-items
  - when it comes to single line
  - through cross axis
  - stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center
7. align-self
  - single version of align-items
  - stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center
8. flex-grow
  - flex-grow factor
  - how much of the flex container's remaining space should be assigned to the flex item's main size
  - flex-shrink: 0; -> not shrinking
9. flex-basis
  - the initial main size of a flex item
  - the flex will grow and shrink form the flex-basis
  - flex-basis is given priority than width

### flexbox attribute
flex container
- display, flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, align-content

flex item
- align-self, flex-grow, flex-basis, order

### flex-wrap application
responsive layout

# reference
### shorthand
border
- border: width, style, color;
- non-sequence

margin & padding
- top right bottom left
- top right-left bottom
- top-bottom right-left
- top-bottom-right-left

flex-flow
- flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap;

flex
- flex-grow
- flex-basis with length or percentage
- flex-grow flex-basis
- flex-grow flex-shrink
- flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis

height
- cannot use %

### margin collapsing
- top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins
- the margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse
