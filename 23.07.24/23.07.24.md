# data structure
### schema
data structure
- specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data
- implement method call

### method
- function belongs to an object
- provide a means of bundling data and functionality together

```python
print(help(str))

'''
Help on class str in module builtins:

class str(object)
 |  str(object='') -> str
 |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str
 |
 |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
 |  errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
 |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
 |  Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
 |  or repr(object).
'''
```

call method
```python
data_type_object.method()
```

# sequence data structure
### sequence types
- sequence, indexing, slicing, length, iteration
- str, list, tuple, range

### str
search/find methods
- s.find(x[, start[, end]])
  - return the lowest index in the string where substring x is found within the slice s[start:end]
  - if "x" wasn't found, return -1
- s.index(x[, start[, end]])
  - search the string for "x" and return the index of where "x" was found
  - like find(), but raise ValueError when x is not found
- s.isalpha(x)
  - return True if all characters in "x" are in the alphabet
- s.isupper(x)
  - return True if all characters in "x" are upper case
  - titlecase is not upper case
- s.islower(x)
  - return True if all characters in "x" are lower case
- s.istitle(x)
  - titlecased version : start with an uppercase and remaining characters are lowercase
  - return True if "x" follows the rules of a title
  
_methods can be chained_

operate methods
- s.replace(old, new[,count])
  - return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new
  - if the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced
- s.strip([chars])
  - return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed
  - the chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed
  - if omitted of None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace
  - the chars argument is not a prefix of suffix, rather, all combinations of its values are stripped
- s.split(sep = None, maxsplit = -1)
  - return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string
  - if maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done
  - if maxsplit is not specified or -1, then there is no limit on the number of splits
- 'serperator'.join([iterable])
  - return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable
  - TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects
- s.capitalize()
  - return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased
  - changed in version 3.8: the first character is now put into titlecase rather than uppercase which means that characters like digraphs will only have their first letter capitalized, instead of the full character
- s.title()
  - return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are lowercase
  - string.capword() function split words on spaces only
- s.upper()
  - return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to uppercase
- s.lower()
  - return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to lowercase
- s.swapcase()
  - return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa
  - s.swapcase().swapcase() == s is not necessarily true

### list
add/remove methods
- L.append(x)
  - add an element at the end of the list
- L.extend(m)
  - add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
- L.insert(i, x)
  - add an element at the specified position
- L.remove(x)
  - remove the first item with the specified value
- L.pop(i)
  - remove the element at the specified position 
- L.clear()
  - remove all the elements from the list

search/array methods
- L.index(x, start, end)
  - return the index of the first element with the x
  - searching from start index up to end index
- L.reverse()
  - reverse the order of the list
- L.sort(*, key = None, reverse = False)
  - sort the list in place, using only < comparisons between items
  - the key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process
  - if reverse set to True, the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed
- L.count(x)
  - return the number of times x appear in the list

# reference
### methods
isdecimal()
- return True if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there is at least one character
- decimal characters are those that can be used to form numbers in base 10

isdigit()
- return True if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, False otherwise
- digits include decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits

isnumeric()
- return True if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there is at least one character, False otherwise
- numeric characters include digit characters, and all characters that have the Unicode numeric value property
  
### sorted function
sorted function
```python
numbers = [3, 2, 1]

print(numbers.sort()) # None
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3]
```

sort method
```python
numbers = [3, 2, 1]

print(sorted(numbers)) # [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers) # [3, 2, 1]
```
